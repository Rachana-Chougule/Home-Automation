# Home Automation with Google Assistant

The Home-Automation project aims to integrate voice control and smart technology to automate domestic activities. By leveraging technologies like voice control and the Google Assistant, this project enables users to control various home appliances using voice commands and smartphone applications. The implementation focuses on integrating lighting and ventilation controls under a single system, allowing for seamless control and management.

## Benefits of Home Automation

Convenience: By automating home activities, daily tasks become more efficient and time-saving. Voice commands and smartphone applications make it easier to control and manage appliances, enhancing convenience in daily life.
Energy Efficiency: Home automation helps save energy by enabling control over appliances remotely. Users can turn off lights or adjust the thermostat even when away from home, reducing energy consumption.
Security and Safety: Integrating the Google Assistant and Gmail account adds an extra layer of security. Users can control their home appliances from anywhere in the world, ensuring a high level of security and safety.

## Tasks

Google Assistant and IFTTT Integration: The system allows control through both the Google Assistant and IFTTT (If This, Then That) smartphone application. Users can give voice commands or set up customized applets to control the devices connected to the home automation system.
Lighting and Ventilation Control: The system provides control over the On-Off status of light bulbs and fans in all four rooms of a house. It ensures security by securing access with a Wi-Fi password known only to the house owners.
Gmail Account Integration: The Google Assistant is connected to the user's Gmail account for added security. Accessing the Gmail account through any smartphone grants the user control over their home from anywhere in the world.
Operational Conditions: 
The home automation circuit requires the following conditions to function properly:
Internet connection for both the smart home and user smartphone.
Power supply to the smart devices in the home and sufficient charging for the smartphone.
Voice commands or IFTTT commands given by the user.
Light Bulb Control: The circuit enables control over four light bulbs.

## Configuring IFTTT

To configure IFTTT for home automation, follow these steps:

Create an account on IFTTT using the same email ID used for Adafruit.
After creating the account, navigate to "My Applets" and select "New Applet".
Choose "Google Assistant" and set voice phrases as commands for the Google Assistant.
Create separate applets for turning the lights on and off, using different phrases for each.
Connect Google Assistant with Adafruit to establish the integration.
Search for Adafruit in the integration options and select it.
Choose the desired action and specify the data to be sent to the corresponding feed on the Adafruit dashboard.

## Conclusion

Home-Automation with Google Assistant offers a convenient and efficient way to control home appliances using voice commands and smartphone applications. By leveraging the Google Assistant and IFTTT, users can enjoy the benefits of automation, energy efficiency, and enhanced security in their homes. Follow the provided steps to configure IFTTT and enjoy the convenience of controlling your home with voice commands and smart technology.
